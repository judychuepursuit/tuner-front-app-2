  <h2>lab-express-sql-seed-read: Backend</h2>
 The EXPRESS app (use git init -y) uses the following installs and dependencies: express, nodemon, dotenv, cors- also add a ‘VALIDATIONS” (checks apps) & “queries” (get, create, delete and update/put) folder. 
This App requires a db folder that has a dbconfig.js, schema.sql (contains the table “INFORMATION”) and a  seed.sql file (contains the files “VALUES”).
Include a .env file and type in the PORT=30xx (edit the last digits accordingly). 
Note: Make sure that the .env file has been correctly saved inside the main folder.
